KUPA v4 Final - Interactive Pro Prototype (with images)

This build includes your uploaded hero image and curated public images (Wikimedia Commons links) for marketplace items & select profiles.

Files:
- index.html
- assets/css/styles.css
- assets/js/app.js
- assets/images/hero-community.jpg (your uploaded image)
- assets/images/*.svg (placeholders)
- data/*.json (profiles, news, events, legends, market)

Deploy:
1. Create a GitHub repo and push the contents of this folder into repo root.
2. Enable GitHub Pages (main branch / root).
3. Replace any ui-avatar placeholders with rights-cleared photos if desired by placing images in assets/images/ and updating fields in data/profiles.json.

Notes:
- Marketplace listings are stored in-browser for the prototype. Use a backend for persistence and messaging in production.
- Image sources from Wikimedia Commons used where available and linked in data files.
